# StarGate: Deterministic Pseudorandom Byte Generator

🚀 This project is backed by the paper "Improving the Security of Cryptographic Keys Using Modified Chaotic Models" by Daniil Baikalov (PDF available in repo).

## Description
StarGate is a deterministic pseudorandom byte generator (PRNG) designed for cryptographic applications, emphasizing high diffusion, nonlinearity, and computational efficiency. The algorithm is based on matrix transformations and uses a compact internal state (~547 bytes), making it ideal for lightweight systems such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices, real-time encryption, and key generation.

## Key Features
* Matrix Architecture: Central 16×16 byte matrix, initialized from a 256-byte key.

* State Components:
16×16 matrix (256 bytes).
16 matrix gates of 4×4 (256 bytes).
Pool of recent bytes (32 bytes).
Coordinates (X, Y) and offset accumulator (offsetSum) — 3 bytes.

* Operations:
Dynamic matrix navigation.
XOR-crosses, row reverses, cyclic column shifts.
Modular transformations through gates.
Nonlinear mixing with the pool.

* Performance: ~9.09 MB/s on iMac 2023 (Apple M2, 8 cores, 3.5 GHz), comparable to Salsa20 with a smaller state size.

* Statistical Randomness: Passes 78–80/80 NIST STS (SP 800-22) tests, including Frequency, BlockFrequency, ApproximateEntropy, and others (97.5–100% success rate).

StarGate combines ease of implementation in Go with potential for hardware optimization (FPGA, microcontrollers). 

> **Important**: This is an experimental PRNG. Full cryptanalysis is required for production use to verify resistance to differential/linear attacks.
Detailed algorithm description, including the block diagram, is available in the original article (author: Baykalov Daniil, 2025).

## Architecture (Overview)

1. Initialization: Key → 16×16 matrix + 16 4×4 gates.
2. Byte Generation:
Update coordinates (X, Y) based on offsetSum.
Extract byte from matrix[M[X][Y]].
Apply XORCross (row/column mixing).
Reverse row + shift column.
Pass through 16 gates (modular addition).
Mix with pool (MixByte).
Update state and pool.
3. Output: Deterministic pseudorandom byte.

Full sequence is detailed in the article's "Byte Generation Algorithm" section.

## Limitations and Warnings

* Cryptosecurity: Preliminary NIST tests are successful, but analysis for attacks (differential, correlation) is needed. Do not use in production without verification!
* Key: Must be 256 bytes, generated by a cryptographically secure PRNG (not sequential values!).
* Testing: Run NIST STS on your stream for validation.
